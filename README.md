##Problem Statements

Note: These are not exclusive to the projects that will be worked on but provide a starting initiative.

* If I am a person with a disability who uses the bus system, how will I know if the path of travel from my residence or business to the bus stop and from the bus stop Â to my destinations is accessible?
* Cities have accessibility information about paths of travel, bus systems have accessibility information about bus stops, how can these pieces be integrated and made usable by individuals with disabilities? 
* How can accessibility information documented by cities be integrated with bus trip planning software to provide seamless accessibility information for customers with limited mobility? For example, streams/rivers, contours, demographics, vulnerable populations.
